# Chip-8 Emulator

This is my attempt to create a Chip-8 emulator in Java. Mostly to learn more about emulation and how it works because I was just really curious! Feel free to fork it and play around with the code if you want, just be warned that it is currently incomplete and not working at all.

## About Chip-8

Chip-8 is an interpreted programming language used mostly for games from the late 1970s. So were actually writing an interpreter instead of emulating real hardware. Still, this interpreter acts like a virtual machine with its own memory, registers and pointers so it will be pretty damn close to the real thing!

Since its really small and has a fairly simple set of instructions I figured this would be the most easy project to start with something as complex as emulating hardware and I am sure it will still be quiet a challenge.

## Documentation

The Chip-8 interpreter is really well documented, with lots of detailed information all over the internet. The most complete documentation I found was ["Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference"](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM)

And here is a more in-depth overview of how Chip-8 actually works and operates: ["Mastering CHIP-8"](http://mattmik.com/chip8.html)
