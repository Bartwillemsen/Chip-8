# Chip-8 Emulator

This is my attempt to create a Chip-8 emulator in Java. Mostly to learn more about emulation and how it works because I was just really curious how that works. Feel free to fork it and play around with the code if you want, just be warned that it is currently incomplete.

## About Chip-8

Chip-8 is an interpreted programming languages used mostly for games in the 1970s. So were actually writing a interpreter for this language instead of emulating real hardware. Still, this interpreter acts like a virtual machine with its own memory, registers and stuff so it will be pretty damn close to the real stuff!

Since its really small and has fairly simple instructions I figured this would be the most easy project to start with something as complex as emulating hardware and I am sure it will still be quiet a challenge

## Documentation

The Chip-8 interpreter is really well documented, with lots of detailed information all over the internet. The most complete documentation I found was ["Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference"](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM)
